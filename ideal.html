The Job: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38554976">Service Delivery Manager Australia - Cochlear</a> 
						</br>
<a class="image-link" href="images/job.JPG">Snapshot of advertisement</a> 
<p></p>
The position is located within the IT department, and manages the delivery and execution of IT operations, as well as the Service Delivery Strategy for the region of Australia. 
It is an overarching role that focusses on delivering, maintaining, and improving all aspects of IT service to the business. 
<ul>
												<li>Delivering: developing and executing a Service Delivery Strategy.</li>
												<li>Maintaining: ensuring key metrics (such as KPIs and SLAs) are being met.</li>
												<li>Improving: identifying risks, liaising with the business to collate information and identify areas for improvement.</li>
											</ul>
<p></p>
A managerial role such as this will require a broad set of skills, which is one of the aspects that draws me to the role. My IT skills are already broad, but not specialized. I have worked in IT for 10+ years primarily in desktop support, which has resulted in advanced troubleshooting skills and extensive experience with Microsoft environments &ndash; Windows OS, Server, and Office 365. Around 3 years ago I moved in to the IT Administration space, being the sole point of contact for a medium business. My most recent role involved all aspects of IT Administration for a large construction business, while also overseeing the service delivery of a remote helpdesk team of 8 people. My key responsibilities were procurement, asset management, contract management, and overseeing all on-site IT requirements at more than 20 locations.
<p></p> The thing that I love most about my job is actually helping people. Everyone is required to interact with technology in the workspace, but it doesn&rsquo;t come naturally to everyone. I enjoy helping people by removing the barriers that may exist for them. Although I do enjoy my job, my career aspirations include the lofty goal of never doing another password-reset for a user. A role such as &ldquo;Service Delivery Manager&rdquo; is actually the epitome of helping people. 
<p></p>The path that I will need to take over the next 5 or so years to land a role such as this will have 2 key requirements: firstly I will need to grow and formalize my skills with Microsoft products, as well as establishing thorough proficiency in another area of IT that would be beneficial to the role. This will enable me to take on a role in a large organization where they have the resources to employ specialized IT staff, rather than the extremely broad and varied roles that have comprised my career so far. 
<br/>Secondly I will need more management experience &ndash; both people and business as well as project management. Moving to a larger organization will also assist with this goal: working in a larger team will afford me opportunities to mentor staff, and I will gain project experience under frameworks that are typically used in larger organizations. 
<p></p>This particular role requires formal qualifications, namely a bachelor&rsquo;s level degree and ITIL certification. Many comparable roles also require similar qualifications, which is one of my main drivers in enrolling to study with RMIT. I am already on my way there. I have recently quit my IT Administrator position. There was a clear ceiling above me: there was no room to grow, and no team to work sideways in to. I have taken a paycut and accepted a position on the service desk at a government department. Less responsibilities in this role will afford me the time to work on formalizing my skills. I hope that over the next 4 years while I study towards obtaining my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree with RMIT I am able to work my way up in this organization, and just keep taking deliberate steps towards my Ideal Job.
