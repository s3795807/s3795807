							<p>
							<p>Let me take you back to the year 1990. I was 6 years old and had a friend across the road named Eleanor. We would spend hours after school watching her brothers play games on their family&rsquo;s computer: an XT beast with CGA graphics and 64kb of RAM. Imagine my absolute shock and joy when, returning home from school one day I find that very same computer set up in my bedroom. Thanks mum! It was a moment that has had a huge impact on my life &ndash; from sparking an early interest in tinkering and technology, to friends made on the other side of the globe, and the career path that I am on today &ndash; it can all be traced back to that moment.</p>
<p>I have chosen to study at RMIT with an end goal of raising the ceiling on my career progression. I have been working in IT for the past 10 years &ndash; starting out on helpdesk, moving to field tech work, and then in to IT Administration. My IT knowledge is very broad, but not highly specialized in any area. My aim is to upskill in an area of IT &ndash; namely Service Delivery &ndash; and push my career along further. RMIT offers this course through OUA, which will enable me to continue working full time while studying. I am excited that a reputable learning provider such as RMIT is finally offering this subject area through this study method.</p>
<p>All of my IT skills are self-taught. I am naturally inquisitive, and naturally independent. This has resulted in some gaps in my knowledge, and no formal framework around my knowledge. It is hard to define and hard to prove what I am capable of. I hope that during the course of my studies I will learn more about IT in large corporations, improve my technical language skills, and develop my understanding of service delivery and how it works in larger organisations.</p>
