<p>There is a few results in these tests that stand out: high scores in assertiveness, prospecting, and agreeableness, and a very low score in aural learning. <br />The assertiveness score is juxtaposed against turbulence, which is a proposition that I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with. I agree with the low score on turbulence: I consider myself calm and level headed. But I don&rsquo;t really think that that equals assertiveness, and I believe that this opinion is backed up by the high score in agreeableness.<br />I think that the above behaviors are highly dependent on the environment and people around me. If I am feeling comfortable and happy, then I probably can be assertive. But If I am not, then I have a tendency to shrink in to the background. I need to be aware of this when working in a team if I want my opinion to be heard.<br />The Myers-Briggs test result gave an overall &ldquo;type&rdquo; of mediator. Considering this, I believe I would benefit from being in a team that includes people with very strong opinions, and that those people would benefit from having me in the team. I think that I will be able to bring strong characters and opinions out of people with my agreeable nature, and as a mediator be able to bring these opinions together to form the final product of the teamwork exercise.</p>
